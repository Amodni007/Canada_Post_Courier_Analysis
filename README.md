# 🇨🇦 Canada Post 3PL Partnership Project

This project explores the strategic and operational transformation of Canada Post’s parcel delivery services through partnerships with third-party logistics (3PL) providers. The initiative blends market research, pricing analysis, and service evaluation to address rising competition and operational inefficiencies in Canada’s courier ecosystem.

---

## 📦 Project Context

Canada Post is facing increasing pressure from agile private couriers due to:
- Rising delivery costs
- Limited reach in rural/underserved areas
- Accelerating e-commerce demands
- Labor disruptions and delivery unreliability

In response, this project investigates how Canada Post can collaborate with 3PL providers to:
- Improve delivery speed and service coverage
- Strengthen customer trust
- Optimize costs through shared infrastructure
- Modernize tracking and integration capabilities

## 🔍 Problem Statement: Courier Pricing Analysis

Parcel shipping in Canada is disproportionately expensive and inefficient—especially for short intercity distances (e.g., Calgary to Edmonton). This project asks:

### 🧩 Key Questions
- Why is parcel shipping in Canada so expensive?
- How do public vs private courier services compare in pricing, service levels, and reach?
- What impact have labor strikes or service delays had on consumer trust?
- Could 3PL partnerships enable Canada Post to deliver faster, cheaper, and more reliably?

> **Hypothesis**: Strategic 3PL collaborations will reduce transit costs, enhance service flexibility, and allow Canada Post to reclaim market share from private couriers.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Conduct detailed market research on major Canadian 3PL providers
- Analyze delivery speed, pricing models, technology capabilities, and environmental commitments
- Evaluate compatibility with Canada Post's operational needs
- Propose data-backed 3PL partnership strategies
- Document insights and performance metrics
