# 📦 Canada Post Courier Pricing Analysis

Data-driven analysis of courier pricing in Canada, exploring high costs, strike impacts, and 3PL partnership potential for improving Canada Post’s intercity parcel delivery.

## 🔍 Project Objective
This project investigates the disproportionately high cost and inefficiency of parcel delivery in Canada—especially for short intercity distances (e.g., Calgary to Edmonton). We examine:
- Why Canada Post and other courier services charge so much.
- How strike news, unreliable service, and lack of 3PL partnerships affect consumer trust and market share.
- Opportunities for cost reduction and better coverage using 3PL models.

## 🧩 Key Questions
- Why is parcel shipping in Canada so expensive?
- How do private vs public couriers compare in price and coverage?
- How have strikes or service delays affected usage patterns?
- Could 3PL partnerships help Canada Post compete better?
